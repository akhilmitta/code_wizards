<h2 class="class1" id="centeralign"> The Joker </h2>

<p class="class1">The Joker is a fictional character, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics. He is an archenemy of Batman. Created by Jerry 
Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane. The Joker first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring 1940). Throughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as 
a master criminal whose characterization has varied from that of a violent psychopath to a goofy trickster-thief. He is the archenemy of Batman, having 
been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin. 
Throughout the character's long history, there have been several different origin tales; they most commonly depict him as falling into a vat of chemical 
waste, which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red, giving him the appearance of a clown. Joker was played by Cesar Romero, 
Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix in movies. On animated shows/movies he is portrayed by Mark Hamill, Kevin Michael Richards on, 
Larry Storch, Jeff Bennett, and John DiMaggio.</p>

<p> Here are the 3 best stories about joker in the comics! </p>

<h4> 1. Batman: White Knight </h4>
<p>The Joker isn’t a character keen to turn hero like so many other comic book super villains, but Sean Gordon Murphy’s <b>Batman: White Knight</b> sees 
the funnybook felon in something of a role reversal with the World's Greatest Detective. After winning a lawsuit against the GCPD and receiving a cure for
his criminal condition, Joker jumps into the political arena to rule Gotham once and for all – through electioneering. But can he really walk the straight 
and narrow or are his plans more pernicious? Murphy crafts a world that pulls in details from so many different iterations of the Batman mythos that this 
comic works as a sort of a love letter to one of the greatest hero/villain rivalries in fiction even while turning it on its head. </p>

<h4> 2. Batman: The Man who laughs! </h4>
<p> For readers who prefer a more modern storytelling approach, Ed Brubaker and Doug Mahnke’s <b>The Man Who Laughs</b> serves as a great update to the 
Joker’s origin. The script pulls some of the more disparate elements of the character together and repackages them to create a more complete picture of the 
Clown Prince of Crime. Brubaker uses the weight of continuity to give the story more stakes and momentum. And coupled with Mahnke’s nightmarish vision of 
the villain, this is a stylish retelling of Joker’s origins that brings him some added depth and context. </p>

<h4> 3. Joker's Five-Way Revenge! </h4>
<p> Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams craft a stone-cold classic with this issue <b> Joker's Five Way Revenge </b>. The Joker is an unrelenting force of death 
and destruction but he does it with a severe commitment to the bit that makes this story so fun. What’s funny is that he almost defeats Batman but decides 
against killing him because he doesn’t want to win out of sheer luck. Instead, he puts together a much more complicated plot involving a shark that doesn’t 
go as planned. It might be an unceremonious end for the Joker in this one as he gets beat up on the beach, but this story speaks to Joker’s single 
mindedness and strange personal motivations.</p>
